# Shiver
Quantifying the vibrations a football team gives its fans during a game or a season

When you watch a football game, and support one or the team, there is something that can really give you goosebumps or make you sad for weeks: the way your team has handled the time during which it was one or more goals down and then made a great comeback to level up
or even bring three points, and vice versa.

This is in my opinion what makes a fan shiver regardless of the ranking of his or her team. At the end of a game, the three points make you happy, but what makes you shiver is the way your team was close to a different situation and eventually made it.

Well, I can believe that some may think differently, but anyway, here is the index for you.

The point of the shiver index is to quantify how many points should have been earned by each team given the time they played in the final configuration.

Let's look at a specific example.
<dl>
  <dt>Season 2017-8. Ligue 1. Day 1.</dt>
  <dd>Angers meets Bordeaux. Final result : 2-2.</dd>
  <dt>Time of goals for Angers :</dt>
  <dd>11 - 88</dd>
  <dt>Time of goals for Bordeaux :</dt>
  <dd>29 - 52</dd>
</dl>

So if you are supporting le Sco d'Angers, you witnessed your team winning for (29-11) 18
minutes, losing for (88-52) 36 minutes and conceding a draw for (11 +(52-29)+ 2+ extra time) 36
minutes.

They got 1 point for a situation held for 36 minutes. They lost for a similar amount of time and
won for half this time.

The Shiver index for Angers will be

1-((18 * 3)+(36 * 1)+(36 * 0) /90)= 1-1 = 0

The Shiver index for Bordeaux will be

1-((36 * 3)+(36 * 1)+(18 * 0)/90))= 1-1.6 =-0.6

Bordeaux brought back from Angers 0.6 points less than their team got during the course of the
game. Angers deserved this point but no more.
The lower your Shiver index, the higher the disappointment.

This also means that there is no or very little difference in the Shiver index between a team
scoring in the first minute and winning 10-0 at the 90th minute and a team finishing with a 0-0
draw.

So this is what the Shiver index of the first day of the 2017-8 season looks like.
